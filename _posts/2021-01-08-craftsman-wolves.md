Prep
----

**Manufacturer recommended recipe**
- bring 1/2 cup of milk to a simmer
- add 1/3 cup of CAW dark sipping chocolate (about 5 tablespoons)
- whisk

This results in a velvetty, thick, intense, sweet/tart drink that is meant to be *sipped*.  
Using this recipe, 1 bag equals 6 servings.

**Less-intense, more drinkable**:
- 1 cup (8-fl oz / 236 mL) milk
- 75g (approximately 3 heaping tablespoons); less and it tastes bland
- stirred and warmed to 68–70°C (154.4-158°F)

This results in a rich drink that's not too thick.

Notes
-----
- Valrhona 80% (Coeur de Guanaja)
- This comes as a powdered mix, with sugar and some salt.
- I don't recommending adding *more* sugar to sweeten this, as it can be overpowering.
