![Chocolate Stash](/images/stash.jpg)

I love hot chocolate — especially the sipping or drinking kind; slightly thick and indulgent, not too sweet, and with just a hint of bitterness. This is in contrast to the more common, American-style hot cocoa, which has a more watery or milky consistency and tends to be overly sweet.

I've made it a game of finding different kinds of chocolates (bars, blocks, mixes, powders) and serving it as a drink. Many are misses — as they were meant to be eaten like candy or used for baking. Though there are quite a handful of gems.

Some hot chocolate drinks like to be dressed up in marshmallow, cream, or shavings, whereas others stand very well on their own. I'm looking for those that can be enjoyed on a more frequent, say daily or weekly basis — served maybe as a morning pick-me-up, a mid-afternoon break from work, or an after-dinner treat.
