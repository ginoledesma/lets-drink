* 3: "*just right*", even kids would like this
* 4: a tad too sweet
* 5: diabetes-inducing (syrup / caramelized sugar)

Thickness

* 1: Diluted/Watery; might as well be skim milk and food coloring
* 2: How most people probably like it: milky, creamy
* 3: Rich but not overpowering; best enjoyed when sipping slowly
* 4: Needs a spoon, or tongue to wipe it all off

Overall
-------
* 0: Hard Pass
* 1: Don't feel too bad if you don't finish it…
